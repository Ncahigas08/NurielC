                    <p>I found this activity great in understanding the ways that intersectionaly affects how systems of power work. It was very informative. I found myself most connecting to my ethnic identity as a sino-viet person. </p>

                    <p> Wow, I didn't realize how many identities were really affecting my life and how I saw myself. I resonated the most with both my gender and ethnic identity as a trans filipinx person. I'm glad there is more visibility around local issues
                        around identity. </p>

                    <p> I have never heard of the term intersectionality before reading this website, but I am glad that I was able to learn more history around organizing. My school doesnt really teach us much about this type of history... I am excited to
                        look towards more around this history!</p>
