                <p> First and foremost, i really hate the texture of a tomatoe. Tomatoes are never a good texture.</p>
                <p> They always tend to be the worst texturing of all the types of foods out there. And to specify I am talking about raw tomatoes. Raw tomatoes are the worst abominations of tomatoes known to man kind. </p>
                <p> You never know what you are going to get with a tomatoe. It will always be either wayyy too mushy or it will be over ripe and like you are eating an apple. </p>
                <p> The worst offender of this texture abomination has to go towards those <strong>heirloom tomatoes.</strong></p>
                <p> Additionally, it always feels like you are biting into skin. Like they feel a little to uncomfortably like skin for me to happily eat. No thank you sir, I would not like to eat a skin tomatoe.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> Dont get me wrong, this is coming from a vegitarian who has and will continue to eat all types of fruit and vegetables but <strong> TOMATOES ARE THE WORST OFFENDERS. </strong></p>

                <p> Second of all, they taste terrible!</p>
                <p> No offense to anyone who actually enjoys tomatoes (im sorry but you are a masochist), but these abominations... at this point they dont deserve to be called a "food item".... are absolutely disguisting </p>
                <p> Of course you could take everything that I do say with a grain of salt but god damn, are these things so sour? bitter? literally anything but sweet i think??</p>
                <p> They have no distinct flavour that would make me want to come to them over and over and over again. They just arent that good. </p>
                <p> They are like cilantro. Like my very one personal hell of abomination cilantro. They just make me queasy and hate absolutely everything about life if I am given a raw tomatoe. </p>
                <p> If you even think that they may be a semblence of good... you are lying to yourself. </p>

                <p> THE SEEDS. OH GOD THE SEEDS. WHY ARE THEY EVERYWHERE ARE THEY CRUNCHY OR NOT WHAT EVEN I CANNT. </p>
                <p> The seeds are one of the more disguisting aspects of tomatoes that I just cant get around. For raw tomatoes especially, the seeds just get on my nerves. </p>
                <p> The seeds arent necessarily as unnoticable as the strawberry seeds, nor could you just take them out like apple or peach seeds. </p>
                <p> The seeds specifically just have this incredible ability to make me want to puke because there are so many of theme and combined witht the terrible textures that I had mentioned at the top... </p>
                <p> That just makes for the worst combo known to mankind. Please. We need to cancel tomatoes like yesterday. </p>
